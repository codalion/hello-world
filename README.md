# hello-world
This is my first repository~

% I am used to programming with Matlab.
disp('Hello World!')

% It't a good beginning isn't it?
% New things are always full of magic power for me!

// C++ is another Power Source!
#include <iostream> 
using namespace std;
int main()
{
   cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
   return 0;
}
